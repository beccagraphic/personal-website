      <h1> About</h1>
      <p id="intro" class="copy">I am a visual thinker and a people person. Over the past few years, I have been drawn towards opportunities that allow me to develop these two qualities. My career is consumed by employment that further enhances my love of design and utilizes my enthusiasm to lead. My passion for design is highlighted through over 5 years of professional marketing experience. My desire to collaborate with others led me to supplement my bachelorâ€™s degree and pursue an MBA with a focus in Marketing & Leadership.Currently, I am in charge of all communication and marketing content for Legacy, an engineering based manufacturing company in NYC. In my free time, I freelance for several companies.</p>
